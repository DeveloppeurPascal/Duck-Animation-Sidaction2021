# Duck Journey Animation - Gaming for Sidaction 2021

[Cette page en français.](LISEZMOI.md)

For [Sidaction 2021](https://www.sidaction.org/), I took part in the [Gaming For Sidaction](https://serialstreameur.fr/sidaction-2021.php) fund-raising operation organized by the [Choeur de Gamers](https://choeurdegamers.fr) association on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/patrickpremartin). My weekend was devoted to coding video games and demos around video game development in Pascal under Delphi.

In this repository you'll find the source code for [a little cartoon](https://serialstreameur.fr/promenade-d-un-canard-animation-faite-avec-delphi.html): a duck walking on the water of a river in the English countryside. I created it to show how to animate on-screen elements with a minimum of coding, using FireMonkey components. As we'd already played with a duck image for the rest of the weekend, I stuck with it.

Other projects that may be of interest to you also got underway over the weekend: [Delphi FMX Game Snippets](https://fmxgamesnippets.developpeur-pascal.fr) and the video game [Ok Ducky!](https://okducky.gamolf.fr).

This code repository contains a project developed in Object Pascal language under Delphi. You don't know what Delphi is and where to download it ? You'll learn more [on this web site](https://delphi-resources.developpeur-pascal.fr/).

## Compatibility

As an [Embarcadero MVP](https://www.embarcadero.com/resources/partners/mvp-directory), I benefit from the latest versions of [Delphi](https://www.embarcadero.com/products/delphi) and [C++ Builder](https://www.embarcadero.com/products/cbuilder) in [RAD Studio](https://www.embarcadero.com/products/rad-studio) as soon as they are released. I therefore work with these versions.

Normally, my libraries and components should also run on at least the current version of [Delphi Community Edition](https://www.embarcadero.com/products/delphi/starter).

There's no guarantee of compatibility with earlier versions, even though I try to keep my code clean and avoid using too many of the new ways of writing in it (type inference, inline var and multiline strings).

If you detect any anomalies on earlier versions, please don't hesitate to [report them](https://github.com/DeveloppeurPascal/Duck-Animation-Sidaction2021/issues) so that I can test and try to correct or provide a workaround.
